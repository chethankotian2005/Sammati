# UI Spec — Sammati

## 1. Design direction
**Concept: "Consent as a receipt you can hold."** Familiar like GPay (white surfaces, big rounded actions, bottom nav), but the memorable element is the **Consent Pass**: each company is a card-like pass whose purposes are switches, and a withdrawal visibly *cuts the pass* (the purpose row greys out and the company's next request turns red on screen). Spend boldness there; keep everything else quiet.

Avoid: cream and terracotta, black plus neon, identical grey-shadow card grids, all-caps labels on everything, decorative gradients.

### 1.1 Tokens

| Token | Hex | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `ink` | `#16173F` | Primary text, app bar, primary buttons (deep indigo-night) |
| `marigold` | `#F4A300` | Brand accent, scan button, highlights |
| `paper` | `#F6F7FB` | App background |
| `surface` | `#FFFFFF` | Cards, sheets |
| `allow` | `#12805C` | ALLOWED, active consent |
| `block` | `#C8283B` | BLOCKED, withdrawn, tamper alerts |
| `mute` | `#6B6F8C` | Secondary text |
| `line` | `#E3E5F0` | Dividers |

Company identity colours (pass headers): QuickLoan `#2F5BEA`, MediCare+ `#0E9AA7`, FoodRush `#E4572E`.

### 1.2 Type
- **UI:** Manrope (400, 500, 700, 800). **Indic fallbacks:** Noto Sans Devanagari, Noto Sans Kannada, loaded and tested on the phone.
- **Hashes and tx ids:** IBM Plex Mono, shortened as `0x4f2a…9be1`, tap to copy.
- Scale (wallet): 28 / 20 / 16 / 14 / 12. Sentence case everywhere. Minimum body size 14, touch targets at least 48 dp.

### 1.3 Shape and motion
- Radius: 20 on passes and sheets, 14 on rows, 999 on switches and the scan button. Do not use one radius for everything.
- Motion only on user action or a real event: switch flip, pass-cut animation on withdraw (row slides to grey, 250 ms), live feed row inserting from top with a brief colour wash (green or red). No page-load choreography. Respect reduced-motion.

## 2. Wallet screens (Flutter)

### W0 Splash and onboarding
- Splash with logo only. Onboarding: 3 short screens ("See every company that has your consent", "Say yes to a purpose, not to everything", "Withdraw in one tap").
- Language picker first (English, हिन्दी, ಕನ್ನಡ).
- Create wallet: "Secure with fingerprint or PIN". No jargon.

```
Empty state: "No companies yet. Scan a QR code to connect your first one."

### W2 Scan
Camera full screen, QR frame, torch toggle. On success: haptic and slide to W3.

### W3 Consent notice
- Header: company name, sector, "Asking for 3 purposes".
- Per purpose: title, one-sentence plain description, data categories as small chips, retention ("kept for 12 months"), third-party sharing flag in `block`-tinted chip when true, expiry dropdown, switch (default off).
- Required-for-service purposes are labelled "Needed for the service".
- Footer: "You can withdraw any purpose later, as easily as you gave it." Primary button "Give consent (2)" showing count; disabled when nothing is on.
- On tap: biometric prompt, then W4.

### W4 Confirmation
Animated stamp, then a receipt: company, purposes, expiry, ledger tx (short, copyable), "Recorded on the ledger". Buttons: "View proof", "Done".

### W5 Company pass detail
- Purpose list with switches, expiry, last used, count of accesses.
- Withdraw flow: flip switch off, bottom sheet "Stop QuickLoan using your data for marketing? They will be blocked right away." Buttons "Withdraw" (red) and "Keep". Result: pass-cut animation and a toast "Withdrawn. QuickLoan blocked."
- Below: **Cascade** section: "Also told: AdPartnerQ ✓ 2 s ago, CreditBureauX waiting…" filling live.

### W6 Activity
- Live feed rows: company dot, purpose, "Credit check · QuickLoan", ALLOWED (green) or BLOCKED (red) chip, time. New items appear at the top.
- Filter chips: All, Allowed, Blocked, by company.
- Tap row opens proof sheet (W7).

### W7 Proof sheet
- Plain sentence first: "This access was recorded and locked on the ledger."
- Rows: record hash, batch anchor tx, Merkle check "Verified ✓" (runs locally, shows green after check), "Open in block explorer".
- For consent receipts: signer (you), ledger head, tx, explorer link.

### W8 Rights
Three actions: "See what a company holds" (access), "Ask a company to erase data" (erasure), "Raise a complaint" (grievance). Each opens a short form (company, note) and shows status: Open, In progress, Resolved.

### W9 Me
Language, security (biometric), wallet address (copy), developer settings (Core URL, network), about.

### W11 Requests inbox (W-14), from the bell on W1 Home
- Home's app bar gets a bell with a count badge (`marigold` fill, number in `ink`) of open requests; the badge is also read by screen readers ("3 requests"). Tap opens W11. The badge and the list update the moment a `consent.requested` arrives.
- W11 lists request cards, newest first. A card: the company's name with its colour dot, "{company} is asking for {n} purposes", the purposes' titles, the company's message under "Message from {company}" if there is one, "Expires in 23 hours". Three actions, each 48 dp: **Review** (primary, opens the consent notice W3 for this request, and everything after that is W3, W4), **Decline** (text button), **Block this company** (text button in `block`).
- Decline signs and removes the card, with the toast "Request declined." Block asks first in a bottom sheet ("Block {company}? They will not be able to send you requests."; **Block** in `block`, **Keep** in the usual place), then signs, removes every card of that company and says "{company} is blocked."
- A new card arrives at the top with a brief colour wash (`marigold` fading to `surface` over 1.2 s; with reduced motion the card is simply there).
- Footer link "Blocked companies": a list with **Unblock** on each, and "You have not blocked anyone." when empty.
- Empty state: "No requests. When a company asks for your consent it will appear here."
- Offline (or Core unreachable): the last known list stays, with the banner "No connection. Showing last known requests." (the same banner pattern as W1). Actions need a connection and say so.

### W12 Your Sammati ID (N-01), from W9 Me
- A row on Me: "Your Sammati ID", its value `asha@sammati` or "No Sammati ID yet". Tap opens W12.
- W12 explains: "Companies can send you consent requests here. They never see your wallet address until you say yes." Without an ID: a field "Choose your ID" with the fixed suffix `@sammati` shown after it, the hint "3 to 30 letters, numbers, dots or dashes", and **Register**. Registering is a device-credential prompt, then the new ID in `ink` with a copy action.
- Errors: not 3 to 30 letters, numbers, dots, underscores or dashes: "Use 3 to 30 letters, numbers, dots or dashes"; taken: "That ID is taken. Try another."; no connection: "Could not reach Sammati. Check Wi-Fi."
- Changing the ID is registering another one; the old one is released. No phone number or email is ever asked for.

### V1 My demo details (V-01, V-06), opened from W9 Me
- Read-only card with the fictional profile: PAN `ABCDE1234F` (IBM Plex Mono), income `6-9 LPA`, credit score `742`.
- Note under it: "Made-up details for the demo. They stay on this phone and are encrypted before they are sent anywhere."
- A quiet footer line, `mute` colour, always shown: "Demo processor (simulated enclave, not real hardware protection)". The simulation is never presented as production security.
- No edit, no copy, no share. It is the only place in the app where the plaintext appears.

### V2 Send securely, on W5 pass detail (V-01, V-04, V-06)
Only on a purpose in `VAULT_PURPOSES` (`credit_check`) while it is Active. Under that purpose row:
- Idle: text button "Send securely" (48 dp) and the hint "{company} gets a decision, not your details. Only the Sammati Processor can open them." Tap: opens W10, where the customer chooses what is sent (the demo details or their own), confirms with the device credential (`auth_reason_vault`), and sees the progress line "Encrypting and sending…". The sent, erased and failed lines below are shown on both screens.
- Sent: `allow`-coloured line with a lock icon, "Sent encrypted. {company} holds only a reference.", then the handle shortened (`0x4f2a…9be1`, tap to copy) and the button reads "Send again" (a new envelope replaces the old one).
- Erased: when `vault.erased` arrives, or the purpose is withdrawn, the line turns `mute` and reads "Your encrypted details were erased." The button is gone while the purpose is withdrawn. Withdrawing needs no extra step: the existing two-tap withdraw is what erases.
- Failed: `block`-coloured line "Could not send securely. Try again." with the existing retry pattern (the button stays). Core or Processor unreachable uses `error_unreachable`; the user declining the device prompt uses `wallet_auth_failed`. A refusal for lack of consent is a failure like any other, never shown as sent.
- The state is held while the app runs; after a restart the section is idle again until the next `vault.stored` / `vault.erased` event (there is no read endpoint for "what do I have stored", on purpose: the wallet does not ask the Processor questions about stored data).
- The vault never changes the pass-cut animation or the cascade list.

### W10 Share your details securely (W-13), after consent or from the QuickLoan pass
Opens from the receipt (W4) as a primary button "Share your details securely" when a data-using purpose was granted, and from "Send securely" on W5 (V2). Closing it never withdraws anything.
- Intro: "{company} needs these to decide your loan. They are encrypted on this phone, so {company} never sees them."
- A button "Use demo details" fills the three fields from the demo profile (and sends the demo score with them).
- Fields: **PAN** (text, upper-cased as typed, hint "Like ABCDE1234F", error "Enter a PAN like ABCDE1234F" shown after the field was touched), **Income band** (choice of four: up to 3 LPA, 3 to 6 LPA, 6 to 9 LPA, 9 LPA and above), **Employment** (choice of four: salaried, self-employed, student, unemployed). Nothing is pre-filled; "Send securely" stays disabled until all three are valid.
- Send: device-credential prompt (`auth_reason_vault`), "Encrypting and sending…", then the sent state of V2 ("Sent encrypted. {company} holds only a reference.", the handle shortened) and a "Done" button. Failed, unreachable and refused states are V2's.
- The fields live only in this screen's memory: they are cleared once sent, and when the screen closes. Nothing is logged, saved or shown on any other screen.
- A standing line, as on V1: "Demo processor (simulated enclave, not real hardware protection)".

### Edge states
Offline banner "No connection. Showing last known consents."; expired consent chip "Expired 3 days ago, give consent again"; QR from a different network "Could not reach Sammati. Check Wi-Fi."; failed transaction "Could not record this. Try again" with retry.

### W13 Alerts (N-05, W-11), the notification centre: a tab on W1
- The bottom bar becomes Consents · Activity · [Scan] · **Alerts** · Rights · Me. Alerts has an unread **dot** (`marigold`, 10 dp, with a text alternative "Unread alerts" for screen readers) on its icon while anything is unread. Labels stay one short word in each language so six items fit at 360 dp; every item is still at least 48 dp.
- The list is newest first under two headers, **Today** and **Earlier**. An item: the company's colour dot and name, an icon for the type (`schedule`, `event_busy`, `autorenew`, `delete_outline`, `done_all`), one plain sentence, its time ("2 min ago"), and, if unread, the dot at the start. Unread items sit on `surface`, read ones on `paper`; a state is never colour alone (the dot, the bold sentence and the icon all change).
- Sentences: expiring "Your consent for {purpose} at {company} expires in {time}"; expired "Your consent for {purpose} at {company} has expired" (the same wording as W1's chip, "Expired {n} days ago, give consent again"); renewal requested "{company} asks you to renew your consent for {purpose}" with the company's message under "Message from {company}"; erased "{company} erased your data for {purpose} (after you withdrew consent / after consent expired)"; cascade "{processor} confirmed it stopped using your data for {purpose}".
- Actions are text buttons of 48 dp under the sentence: **Renew** (primary), **Let expire**, **View proof**. Renew calls Core for a renewal request and opens the consent notice W3 for that one purpose with the expiry choices (and **2 minutes (demo)** when Core says `fastExpiry`); everything after is W3 and W4. Let expire records the choice and says "Okay. This consent will expire on its own." View proof opens the proof sheet W7 for that consent. An item whose consent has since been renewed shows "Renewed" instead of its actions, and one left to expire shows "Left to expire".
- A new alert arrives at the top with the same brief colour wash as W11 (reduced motion: it is simply there). Tapping an item, or any action, marks it read; **Mark all as read** sits in the app bar. The banner "No connection. Showing last known alerts." appears when Core cannot be reached, with the list kept.
- Empty: "No alerts. Expiry reminders and updates from companies will appear here."
- On a consent card (W1) and the pass (W5) an expired consent keeps the chip "Expired {n} days ago, give consent again", and tapping it now starts the same Renew flow.

## 3. Company Console (web)

Layout: left rail (Overview, Purposes, Consents, Live requests, Processors, Evidence), top bar with company switcher (QuickLoan, MediCare+, FoodRush).

- **Overview:** four numbers (active consents, allowed today, blocked today, last anchor), live feed beside a small consent trend chart.
- **Purposes:** table plus "Add purpose" drawer (code, plain description in 3 languages, categories, retention, sharing flag).
- **New consent request:** two tabs. **QR (in person)**: choose customer alias and purposes, large QR on right. "Waiting for scan…" then "Consent received" with tx. **Send to user** (N-02): a field "Sammati ID" (placeholder `asha@sammati`), the same purposes picker, an optional message (140 characters, with a counter) and "Expires in" (1 hour, 24 hours, 3 days, 7 days), then **Send request**. The answer is always "Request sent" for a well-formed ID, and the page says so: "We tell you nothing about whether this ID exists." Below, a table of requests sent: ID as typed, purposes, a status chip (Sent, Seen, Granted, Declined, Expired: each with icon and word), sent time, expiry; it updates live from `request.updated`, and a Granted row links to the Consents section. A rate-limit answer reads "You are sending too fast. Try again in {n} seconds."
- **Live requests:** two-column. Left: **Simulator** with big buttons ("Run credit check", "Send marketing SMS", "Share with bureau") firing real requests. Right: feed with ALLOWED/BLOCKED, reason code, latency. Blocked rows use `block` left border and show "451 · Consent withdrawn".
- **Live requests, QuickLoan only (V-05, V-06):** the simulator gains **Run loan decision**. The result row reads "Approved · limit 3,00,000 · SCORE_FAIR" in `allow`, or "Declined · …" in `block`, or the usual "451 · Consent withdrawn". Beside the feed, a **What QuickLoan holds** card shows only what its backend has: handle (short, tap to copy), ciphertext hash, status `stored` / `erased`, and the sentence "QuickLoan staff cannot read this. Only the Sammati Processor can open it." A small timeline under it fills from the `vault.*` and `processor.*` events: Encrypted → Stored → Requested → Decrypting → Decided → Erased, each with its time. No screen of the console shows a PAN or an income. The card also carries the quiet "simulated enclave" label.
- **Consents:** table of customers by purpose with status, filterable. Above it, **Expiring consents** (N-03, N-04): the company's consents that expire within the window or expired within it, soonest first. Columns: customer (the company's own alias), purpose, expires (absolute and relative), a state chip (**Expiring** with `warn` styling, **Expired** with `expired`, each with an icon and the word), the renewal's status chip if one was asked (Sent, Seen, Granted, Declined, Expired), and the action **Request renewal** (48 px tall; while a request is open it reads "Requested" and is disabled). Updates live from `consent.updated` and `request.updated`. Empty: "No consents are about to expire." A rate-limit answer reads "You are sending too fast. Try again in {n} seconds."
- **Processors:** per purpose list, ack state and time.
- **Evidence:** "Generate compliance pack" button, preview, download.

### 3.1 QuickLoan customer portal (`/portal/quickloan`, C-09)

QuickLoan's own customer page, not part of the console: header in `#2F5BEA`, "QuickLoan" and "Loans, quickly." one column, 640 px, large controls (48 px), sentence case. It looks like a company website because it is meant to be taken for one; the footer says "Demo page. Consent by Sammati." The states of `trd.md` §6.10:

- **Logged out:** a card "Sign in to apply", one text input **"Your customer name or ID"** (placeholder "for example Asha"), a button "Continue". There is no password and no other field; in particular none for a PAN or an income. An alias shaped like a PAN is refused with the message "That looks like a PAN. QuickLoan does not need it here."
- **Application form:** "Hello, {alias}". A card "Apply for a loan" with the checkbox **"Allow QuickLoan to use my data for loan purposes"**, unticked. Beneath it, indented and in plain language, the purposes: "Check your credit eligibility" (this is what the box asks for) and, each with its own unticked box, "Send you loan offers" and "Share repayment history with credit bureaus", the latter marked "Shared with third parties". "Apply" is disabled with the line "Allow the use of your data first".
- **Awaiting scan:** the same card with the QR (240 px, white tile) and "Waiting for you to approve in the Sammati app...", a live status chip (● Waiting / ✓ Connected), "Untick to cancel".
- **Consent received:** "✓ Consent received" and "Recorded on the ledger" with the transaction shortened (tap to copy). Beneath, three rows (PAN, Income, Employment), each "Provided securely in your Sammati app" with a lock icon. Apply disabled with "Share your details in the Sammati app".
- **Data submitted:** "✓ Data submitted securely", the handle and ciphertext hash shortened (tap to copy), the line "QuickLoan holds only a reference. Only the Sammati Processor can open your details." Apply enabled.
- **Decided:** a decision card: **Approved** (`allow`, ✓) with "Limit 3,00,000" and the reason codes as chips, or **Declined** (`block`, ✕) with the reasons. No data is shown, only the outcome.
- **Withdrawn:** "Consent withdrawn. Application cannot be processed" in `block` with an icon; Apply disabled; the data rows are replaced by "Your encrypted details were erased" once the Processor says so.
- **Error:** a `block` banner naming what failed, "Try again", and the form is kept.
Status is never colour alone. Every dynamic line is an `aria-live` region.

## 4. Auditor (web)

- **Home:** one card per company with a compliance scorecard (grants, withdrawals, allowed, blocked, avg withdrawal-to-block latency, pending acknowledgements, integrity status).
- **Ledger explorer:** reverse-chronological table with type, principal alias (short address), company, purpose, tx, ledger head; filters on top.
- **Verify integrity:** button per company. Progress rows "Recomputing hash chain… Rebuilding Merkle roots… Comparing with chain anchors…". Result: green "All 148 records match 7 anchors" or red "Mismatch in batch 4, record 63" with a diff of the stored vs expected hash. This is the second hero moment of the demo.
- **Report:** printable page: company, period, verification result, evidence list, anchor links.

## 5. Stage view (`/stage`, for the live demo)
Single screen for the projector: left column "Citizen" (live mirror of the phone via scrcpy window beside it, plus a feed of wallet events), centre three columns for QuickLoan, MediCare+, FoodRush showing live request feeds, right column a ledger ticker (tx, ledger head). The QuickLoan column also shows the confidential-processing timeline (the same chips as the console card, handle shortened) so the audience watches the data go in encrypted, a decision come out and the ciphertext vanish on withdrawal. A thin banner at top: current act of the demo script (optional presenter hint). Large type, high contrast, visible from the back of the room.

### 5.1 Data Flow Inspector (`/stage/flow`, and a panel of `/stage`; V-07, S-04)

The screen that makes "encrypted, and decrypted only inside the processor" obvious from the back of the room in a few seconds. Everything on it comes from real events and real responses (`trd.md` §6.9); nothing is a canned animation.

Layout: a thin header with the title "Data flow", a **Live / Replay** switch, and the presenter controls; four lanes left to right, each a large card with a number, a title and a one-line caption; below them the step timeline and the privacy line. Type is large (lane titles 28, body 20 or more), `ink` and `marigold` for structure, `allow` and `block` only for decision states.

| Lane | Title and caption | Content |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Wallet** · "On the customer's own phone" | The customer's fields in plain text (PAN in Plex Mono, income band, score), because it is their own device. An **Encrypting** step lights on `vault.encrypted` and becomes **Sent encrypted** on `vault.stored` |
| 2 | **In transit and at rest** · "X25519 + AES-256-GCM" | The real ciphertext in Plex Mono, shortened (`0x1a2b…c3d4`, tap to copy in full), the envelope hash (the handle, labelled "Envelope hash"), the size in bytes, and the algorithm label |
| 3 | **QuickLoan staff view** · "What QuickLoan can see" | Two buttons. **Try to view customer data** calls the real admin endpoint and shows exactly what came back: the ciphertext hash and the chip "Not authorised to read content". **Try to read database** shows the raw ciphertext row. This lane never shows a plaintext value: its answers are filtered (`trd.md` §6.9) and anything that looks like data is replaced by "Blocked: looks like plaintext" |
| 4 | **Sealed Processor** · "Demo visualisation of a sealed processor" | A box with four states, **Waiting**, **Decrypting**, **Scoring**, **Decision**, the current one marked. Fields are shown masked, by shape only (`PAN ••••• •••• •`, `Income •••••`, `Score •••`), whatever state it is in. On Decision: Approved or Declined (or Blocked with the reason) in the decision's colour **and** with an icon and a word, the limit, and the reason codes as chips. It renders only `processor.decrypting` and `processor.decided` |

Bottom strip: a step-by-step timeline (Encrypted, Stored, Requested, Decrypting, Decided, Erased) with the time of each step and the gap from the previous one, taken from the events' own timestamps. Under it the privacy line:

- "No plaintext was visible to QuickLoan or any third party" with a shield icon, in `allow`, **only** while the client-side check holds and at least one decision has been seen;
- until then, nothing (no empty claim);
- if a value from the demo profile turns up in any event: "Plaintext found in an event: this must never happen" with a warning icon, in `block`, and it stays.

Presenter controls: **Withdraw and re-run** runs Withdraw, then Apply, and shows the Processor lane go to Decision: Blocked ("451 · Consent withdrawn") and the line "Ciphertext erased" in lane 2 (struck-through ciphertext, a bin icon and the word). For a real phone the control says "Withdraw on the phone now" and waits for that withdrawal, then applies. **Replay** plays the saved recording instead of the live stream (marked with a persistent "Replay of a recording" chip so it is never taken for live). **Save session** downloads the events seen so far.

States: nothing yet (every lane shows its caption and "Waiting for the customer to send their details"); Processor unreachable or Core unreachable ("Live feed offline", chip in the header, controls disabled except Replay); an answer the page cannot read (shown as such, never guessed).

Motion: lane highlights and the Processor state change only on events; the presentation delay (`trd.md` §6.9) paces them; with `prefers-reduced-motion` there is no delay and no transition, the state simply changes. Status is never colour alone: every state and decision has a word and an icon. Tokens from §1.1 only; type sizes are the exception to §1.2 for the projector.

Copy (English only, like the rest of the web console): "Encrypting", "Sent encrypted", "Try to view customer data", "Try to read database", "Not authorised to read content", "Blocked: looks like plaintext", "Waiting", "Decrypting", "Scoring", "Decision", "Demo visualisation of a sealed processor", "Withdraw and re-run", "Withdraw on the phone now", "Ciphertext erased", "Replay of a recording", "Live feed offline".

In `/stage` the inspector is a panel the presenter toggles with a **Data flow** button in the header; the banner names the current act of `demo.md` (S-04).

## 6. Copy and i18n

Voice: plain verbs, sentence case, describe what happens. Errors state what went wrong and what to do, no apologising. An action keeps one name through the flow ("Withdraw" button, "Withdrawn" toast).
